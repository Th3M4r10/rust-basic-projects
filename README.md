# Rust Basic Projects

This repository showcases a collection of simple projects built with Rust, designed to provide a foundational understanding of Rust programming.


## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This repository aims to help beginners understand Rust through practical projects.

## Projects

Below are the projects included in this repository:

1. [Guessing Game](#guessing-game): A simple game where the player guesses a randomly selected number.
2. [Command Line Calculator](#command-line-calculator): A calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations via the command line.
3. [To-do List CLI](#to-do-list-cli): A command-line interface for managing tasks.
4. [Web Scraper](#web-scraper): A tool for scraping data from websites.
5. [Static Blog Generator](#static-blog-generator): Generates static blogs from Markdown files.
6. [Simple HTTP Server](#simple-http-server): A basic HTTP server to serve static content.
7. [Chat Application](#chat-application): A simple chat application for real-time communication.
8. [Concurrent Web Spider](#concurrent-web-spider): A concurrent web crawler for efficiently scraping websites.
9. [Blockchain Simulator](#blockchain-simulator): Simulates blockchain transactions and mining processes.

## Setup Instructions

```bash
cargo new < project_name >
        cd < project_name >

```

### Prerequisites

- Rust installed on your system. If not, install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system, comes bundled with Rust.

### Getting Started

Clone this repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Th3M4r10/rust-basic-projects.git
cd rust-basic-projects
```

Run the projects using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --bin guessing_game
```

Replace `guessing_game` with the name of any other binary in the repository to run it.
